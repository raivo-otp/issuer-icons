# Requirements

> Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply.

- [ ] My issuer icon(s) are fully vector and do not contain (parts of) a JPG/PNG/etc.
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) are somewhat square, so they are nicely visible in the app.
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) start and end with the `<svg>` element.
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) are scalable (they use `viewBox` instead of a static width/height).
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) do not contain whitespace around the SVG ([this](https://jsfiddle.net/u9x423ph/2/) JSFiddle could help to remove whitespace).
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) do not include the `doctype` element.
- [ ] My issuer icon(s) file and directory names are lowercase.
